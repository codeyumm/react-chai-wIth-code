## How to create react app?

`npx create-react-app project-name`

This will create the structure of the project.

We can get all info from **package.json** file
Things like
    - Dependencies
    - Scripts (Which runs the project, build, test...)
    - Linting
    - Browserlist

## To run  the project


`npm run script_name`

`npm run start`


but "npx create-app" command takes lot of time. It's very bulky utility.
So, we will use vite.


## React projcet with vite

Start with

`npm create vite@latest`

Follow the command line instruction
